### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having a university degree in theology, and having worked as a pastor for 14 years, I wanted change and took a MBA. 
My masters degree lit my fire for statistics and scientific leadership research, so I kept working on this on my own. 
But not being a student any more, SPSS got too expensive - so I started coding my own set of statistical resources in Python. 

The result is a toolkit of commonly used statistical tools.
Dataset should be in csv og xlsx with only numeric variables. 

Please feel free to use CORals Analytics, suggest improvements and contribute to the further development of the code!
